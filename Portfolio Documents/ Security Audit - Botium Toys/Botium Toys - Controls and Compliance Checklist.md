#### System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)

| Yes | No  | Best practice   |
|:---:|:---:|:--------- |
|     |  x  | User access policies are established. |
|     |  x  | Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is confidential/private. |

## Recommendations (optional)

- A good place to start would be with establishing user access policies.

- The following step would be to create backups, and implement data encryption.

- Once user access policies are implemented and centrilized with a service like Windows Active Directory or something similar, password policies and role privileges can be easily asigned.

- An Intrusion Detection System should be implemented along the Active Directory.

- Creating a monitoring schedule for legacy systems must be in mind, another solution would be to migrate to a newer technology.
