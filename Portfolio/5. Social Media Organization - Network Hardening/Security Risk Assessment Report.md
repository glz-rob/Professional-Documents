# Security Risk Assessment Report

## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

- Password policies

- Multifactor authentication

- Port filtering

## Part 2: Explain your recommendations

According to the organization's current situation, the first recommendation I have to make is to implement a strong password policy. This will increase the security by making it harder for attackers to steal or guess credentials. This only needs to be implemented once, and no need to update it, unless you are looking higher level of security.

Next is the use of Multifactor Authentication, this will add an extra step to the login in exhange for even increased security, making it near impossible for an attacker to log into an account if he doesn't know the MFA. MFA only needs to be implemented once, and each user will be able to set it up for themselves afterwards.

Lastly, port filtering will reduce stress on the network and increase security, by rejecting traffic directed to unused ports. Port filtering is implemented once, and updated if new services that use disabled ports are added.

These are only the first steps towards having a robust security posture.
